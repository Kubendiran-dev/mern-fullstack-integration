1.What is Fetch? (Interview answer — brief)
fetch() is a built-in JavaScript function used to make HTTP requests to servers (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and handle responses using Promises.

Process:

Call fetch(url, options)

Request sent to server

Server returns response

Convert response → response.json()

Use data in UI / logic

Example flow:

fetch() → request → server → response → json() → use data


2.What is Axios? (Interview answer — brief)
Axios is a third-party HTTP client library used to make API requests from browser or Node.js. It is promise-based and easier than fetch for handling JSON and errors.

Process:

Call axios.get() / axios.post()

Request sent to server









Axios automatically converts response to JSON

Access using response.data

Example flow:

axios → request → server → response → response.data → use data
